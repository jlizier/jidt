Validate using `mutualinformationempirical` that there is (almost) no mutual information between either $X$ or $Z$ with $Y$, yet using `conditionalmutualinformationempirical` that there is (almost) one bit of conditional mutual information from $X$ to $Y$ given $Z$ (or vice versa in $X$ and $Z$). Explain the meaning of the conditioning on $Z$ increasing the apparent mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ - see the next lecture segment.
